# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a popular and efficient algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, or other linear data structures. It involves using two pointers that traverse the data structure:
1. **from different positions or** 
2. **at different speeds**

to find a specific condition or optimize a solution. This method is particularly useful for problems that require searching, comparing, or manipulating elements in a sequence.


## Why Use Two Pointers?
- **Efficiency**: The two pointers technique often reduces the time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n), making it highly efficient for large datasets.
- **Simplicity**: It can simplify code by avoiding nested loops and making the logic more readable.
- **Versatility**: This pattern is applicable to a wide range of problems, including searching for pairs, removing duplicates, reversing strings, and implementing sliding windows.


## Common Use Cases
1. **Finding Pairs**: Such as two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: From a sorted array while maintaining the order of elements.
3. **Reversing Strings**: Or checking for palindromes by comparing characters from both ends.
4. **Sliding Windows**: For problems involving subarrays or substrings with specific properties.
