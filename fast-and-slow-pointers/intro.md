# Fast and Slow Pointers
The Fast and Slow Pointers technique, also known as the **Tortoiseüê¢ and Hareüê∞ algorithm**, is a powerful method for solving problems involving linked lists, arrays, or sequences. Its name is quite self-explanatory. This difference in speed allows us to **detect cycles**, **find midpoints**, or **locate specific elements** efficiently without using extra space.

## Why Use Fast and Slow Pointers
- **Cycle Detection**: Determine if a linked list or sequence contains a cycle.
- **Finding Midpoints**: Locate the middle of a linked list in a single pass.
- **Space Efficiency**: Uses constant extra space (O(1)), ideal for memory-constrained problems.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to various problems like finding duplicates or checking palindromes.
